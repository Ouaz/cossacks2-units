<strong>Low melee damage, hand-to-hand combat only, quickly gains experience.</strong>

<!-- 2 --><p>Although these units can fight only in close combat, they quickly gain experience for killed enemy soldiers and increase their personal combat indexes with that.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Good for outflanking the enemy troops and wiping out peasants.</p>
