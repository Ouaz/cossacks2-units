<!-- 1 --><p>Dragoons appeared in the Russian army long before Peter's ascension to the throne, but became regular detachments during his reign. There were only two dragoon regiments by the time of his succession to the throne. Thus, to ensure a battle-worthy army, Peter began to increase the number of dragoons, such that in the period from 1701 to 1711, the total number of regiments increased to thirty.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>As in the armies of the other European countries, dragoons were only mounted infantrymen. Under the reign of Alexander the First, the dragoons were strengthened by seven more regiments, one of which was the Guard regiment.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>During the Napoleonic wars, Russian dragoons were never used in dismounted order. They appear to have been the most numerous cavalry units in the Russian army.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Dragoon regiments, however, were never numbered and had names instead: the Kharkov Dragoon regiment, the Irkutsk Dragoon regiment, the Orenburg Dragoon regiment, the Kargopol Dragoon regiment, the Nezhin Dragoon regiment, the Moskow Dragoon regiment, etc.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>On the battlefield, dragoons were used for infantry support, as well as for massive cavalry attacks on enemy positions.</p>
<!-- 6 --><p>Dragoons were armed with broadswords and muskets. Well trained riders could direct fire on the enemy from horseback. Their most effective tactic was the short-range volley.</p>
