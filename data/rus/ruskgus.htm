<!-- 2 --><p>Regiments weren't numerated, although they had their own names: the Ahtyn Hussar regiment, the Isum Hussar regiment, the Sumy Hussar regiment, the Elizabeth Hussar regiment, the Mariupol Hussar regiment, the Luben Hussar regiment, the Belorussian Hussar regiment, the Groden Hussar regiment and the Alexander Hussar regiment, etc.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Hussars were mainly used for mounted reconnaissance, ambushing wagon trains, rear column raids and outflanking maneuvers. In battle, they supported infantry and cavalry.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Hussars were armed with sabers and musketoons. A mid-range distance was considered to be their best shooting range as the smallshot used in the hussars' mustketoons inflicted the heaviest damage to the enemy at that distance.</p>
