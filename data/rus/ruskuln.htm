<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Uhlan</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, hand-to-hand combat only, quickly gains experience.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Originally, the Russian army had only Polish and Lithuanian regiments established in 1797, but in 1803, the Tsar's Ukase was ordered to create one more regiment - the Tatar Uhlan regiment.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Uhlans were mostly used for infantry support and for providing infantry cover during deployment. There were hardly any troops that could provide cover better than they did. Furthermore, Uhlans engaged in reconnaissance and sudden assaults on the enemy from ambushes.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Pikes with tassels were the primary Uhlan armament, which distinguished them from the other mounted forces.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>The Uhlans' principle tactical duties included pursuing fleeing enemy forces, carrying out sudden attacks on the enemy from the flanks, as well as supporting the other types of cavalry. They most effectively interacted with mounted Chasseurs and Cossacks.</p>
