<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Chasseur</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, uses rifle.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>During the Patriotic War, the Russian army suffered a lack of light cavalry. The only remaining regiments of Hussars, Uhlans and Cossacks weren't enough, especially since a number of dragoon regiments didn't prove to be very useful.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>A special type of cavalry was required, more flexible than Hussars and Uhlans. Thus, in 1812, mounted-chasseur forces were created based on the example of Napoleon's mounted chasseurs.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Mounted chasseurs were mostly used to perform mounted reconnaissance, assault supply wagon trains and execute sudden ambushes.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Instead of sabers, they were armed with muskets. Well-trained riders could fire from horseback. That allowed them to effectively cooperate with Uhlans and Cuirassiers, and act as the "last shooters".</p>
