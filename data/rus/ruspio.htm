<strong>Average combat capabilities, builds defensive fortifications, can explode buildings with a powder barrel.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Until 1830s in the Russian army, pioneers was a name given to soldiers from sapper companies in engineering units.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>No army could exist without the help of sappers and miners, someone had to build fortifications and help to destroy barriers created by the enemy. Russian pioneers proved to be fairly competent with their job.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>On top of that, far beyond their basic duties, pioneers would fight alongside the regular infantry, resulting in many engineering subdivisions being honored for their courage and quick wit.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>In 1812, the Russian empire possessed two regiments of pioneers, each including twenty-four companies.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>As opposed to muskets, pioneers would be armed with pistols and cutlasses. The pistol was far lighter than a musket, which proved highly important in battle as a pioneer had to carry not only his armament, but also entrenching tools, or large powder charges.</p>
