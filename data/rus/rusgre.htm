<h2 class="dataid">Grenadier</h2>

<strong>Strong in hand-to-hand combat, can explode buildings with grenades, highly resistant to fatigue.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Originally Russian grenadier subdivisions were created based on the example of grenadiers in other European armies. Similarly, grenadiers were recruited out of tall men with robust stature, so as were considered elite infantry.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Still, they were considerably different from foreign units. For instance, a French battalion would have eight regular companies and a grenadier one, consisting exclusively of distinguished soldiers, while in Russia there soon appeared entire grenadier battalions and regiments.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Most frequently those would gather not veterans, but merely tall and strong recruits, namely ex-peasants who, unlike regular infantry, were intensively trained before being sent to battlefield. It would normally take a clash or two to make recruit a skillful warrior, ample of courage and persistence.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Grenadiers of the Russian empire were glorified for their skills at maneuvering and dodging tactical traps. Their equipment was similar to that of the other line infantry.</p>
