<h2 class="dataid">Musketeer</h2>

<strong>Weak hand-to-hand combat capabilities, light coal consumption when shooting, fast training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The Russian musketeer was a firm and courageous soldier, however most of time an ill equipped and wretchedly supplied one. Besides, in the early 19th century, the level of training in the Russian infantry was lower than in other armies of that period.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>It was considered enough for a soldier to be able to march, promptly carry out officer's orders and skillfully load the musket. After Paul's coming to throne, the linear infantry, as opposed to the Katherine's time, was not taught to fight in melee and ranged combat: all the soldier knew was how to hold the formation and when to fire into the side of the enemy.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Still though, saying that Russian musketeers were of no value on the battlefield would be incorrect. The majority of soldiers highly praised their uniform and was up to sparring nothing in the fight for their homeland. Patriotism, multiplied by farmer-like endurance and wit made the Russian soldier a very brave and valorous fighter. It was the lack of proper training, which turned out to be fatal most of the time though.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Musketeers comprised the great bulk of Russian infantry. They fought in dense order - a line, a column or a square - and used the standard tactics of European armies of that period.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Russian musketeers were armed with a musket, a bayonet and a cutlass, the same as other countries' line infantry.</p>
