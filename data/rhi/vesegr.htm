<h2 class="dataid">Chasseur</h2>

<strong>Fast soldier, weak in hand-to-hand combat, good shot, tireless, good for killing enemy officers, heavy coal consumption when shooting.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The word "chasseur" itself means "hunter" in French, which deliberately describes how these troops have been founded and what their way of warfare is.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Being very mobile, they do not endure fatigue during long marches even while moving cross-country.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>They are few in number-per-squad but have a great firepower, which actually makes them ideal skirmishers to slay the enemy troops' officer staffs.</p>
