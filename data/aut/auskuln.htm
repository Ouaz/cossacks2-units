<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Uhlan</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, hand-to-hand combat only, quickly gains experience.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The Austrian army first established Uhlans during the post-Seven Years War reform. At the time of Franz II's accession, there were only 2 Uhlan regiments, while in 1815, 2 more were added - one stationed in Krakow and the other settled in Galician.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>The horsemen's armament was repeatedly changed, starting as early as Joseph II's reign and up until the deployment of pikes in all regiments in 1790.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Uhlans dealt mainly with fast reconnaissance and infantry support, much as the other Austrian light cavalry units. Their priority task was to defend the flanks of the advancing cavalry, along with chasing the fleeing enemy.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>From the very beginning of the Napoleonic Wars until their defeat in 1809, the Austrian army high command used Uhlans mostly impractically, much as they did the entire cavalry.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Despite everything, the Uhlans managed to cope with the problems put before them.</p>
