<h2 class="dataid">Grenadier</h2>

<strong>Strong in hand-to-hand combat, can explode buildings with grenades, fast grenade reload, highly resistant to fatigue, fast training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Grenadiers were considered to be the elite line infantry in every European state. But the shaky military system in Austria was ruthless even to grenadier units.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>In 1805, every Austrian infantry regiment consisted of five battalions: four infantry and one grenadier. The next year, all regiments were reduced in number by one infantry battalion.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>All aspects of military life were rife with utterly stupid rules and stereotypes. Tall and bulky, Austrian grenadiers did not receive any special rations, as the high command considered it to be a luxury. Instead, with the money saved, alcohol was bought to intoxicate soldiers before a battle - grenadiers were privileged with additional portions here - and the quantities consumed usually made the army go battling staggering drunk.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>A separate problem was the outmoded army regulations, established for the entire line infantry. The army regulations instructed grenadier how to walk, stand and breathe with any separate initiative punished even during a battle.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>All these factors made it practically impossible to receive any benefit from the strength and skills of grenadiers during a fight. Nevertheless, the Austrian grenadiers were much more courageous than other soldiers, and fought with great self-sacrifice.</p>
