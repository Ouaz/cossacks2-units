<h2 class="dataid">Landwer</h2>

<strong>Weak in hand-to-hand combat, very fast training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>In Austria, Landwer was the name given to the militia which was established by committees and public counsels for internal needs. This was a hurriedly summoned militia, which enrolled men aged 18 to 45 years.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>In case of an enemy threat, the troops could be summoned into regiments and divisions to support the regular army. The very idea of a national army was always distasteful to authorities. However, immense losses throughout the military campaign of 1805 compelled the creation of such troops. Thus, in July 1808, the Landwer was formed.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The specially appointed officers were supposed to conduct combat training, however no one was really engaged in it. Austrian communities were expected to provide about 200,000 militiamen, however they couldn't amass such a number. Many autonomous governments preferred to create their own militia forces, instead of entrusting their people into the hands of Austrian generals (of notorious reputation).</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>The militia included regular and volunteer units, thus people drawn against their will as well as patriots desiring to defend their homeland in the Austrian army ranks. Except for voluntary units, the majority of other Landwer troops didn't show much worth. On the eve of a battle, nearly two-thirds of the militiamen deserted, unwilling to risk a senseless death under the command of incompetent generals.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>It is interesting to note though that the majority of deserters didn't flee to their homes, but continued to fight against the enemy as guerilla squads, independent of the regular army and its command.</p>
