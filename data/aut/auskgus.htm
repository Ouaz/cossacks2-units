<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Hussar</h2>

<strong>Average melee damage, short rifle (case-shot).</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>This branch first appeared in Hungary - even the name hussar comes from Hungarian "huss" - twenty and "ar" - wages. At the time Franz II (who was afterwards renamed Franz I) ascended the throne, there were ten Hussar regiments in the Austrian cavalry, which, in 1815, was increased to twelve.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Austrian Hussars were supposed to be the most persistent and irreconcilable not only in the Austrian cavalry, but in the whole of Europe.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Hussars, as compared to the entire Austrian cavalry, were much more mobile, in order to direct fire on the enemy rather than wage melee combat. Later, this was prohibited.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Thus, the 1784 Statute which contained all the directives concerning waging war with cavalry, placed major emphasis on describing the forms of saber combat. However, it was prejudiced toward the expediency of delivering a chopping blow - the entire cavalry had to deliver penetrating blows with a broadsword more than with saber.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Later versions of the statute approved Hussars, as well as the rest of the cavalry, functioning as auxiliary elements to protect and support the infantry. So, such cavalry terms of reference as accompanying the infantry as well as initial reconnaissance and waging rear raids came into being.</p>
<!-- 6 --><p>In spite of moderate command incompetence, Hussars mostly coped with their duties perfectly well and deserved the glory of being among the best Austrian army regiments.</p>
