<h2 class="dataid">Borders Man</h2>

<strong>Weak hand-to-hand combat, good shot, light coal consumption when shooting, highly resistant to fatigue, fast training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The military border of Hungary and Transylvania was a narrow strip of ground where every man was ready to withstand an attack from the Turkish territory. People living in the shadow of the Ottoman Empire were hardened by continuous wars with the Turks.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>In those lands, every man received basic military training and was taught marksmanship. In case of war, the population of these areas could form battalions to support the regular army. Such battalions united into so-called Boardsmen regiments (Grenz-Infanterie).</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The number of such regiments was considerable and made up about a quarter of the army. However, heavy losses during the Turkish wars and depressed economic conditions led to the force's diminution from roughly 57,000 men to only 13,000 by 1799. The number of regiments remained the same, but the manning each was drastically reduced.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Additionally, the Austrian military command never held Boardsmen in much esteem. This attitude was a result of the headstrong temperament of the Boardermen which often caused severe conflicts with the Prussians. Some generals eloquently called Boardsmen helpless, deceitful and absolutely undisciplined and they insisted on the disbandment of the border regiments.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>This opinion didn't change despite Boardsmen becoming heroes in numerous battles in which they were glorified for their marksmanship and initiative.</p>
