<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Light Dragoon</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, uses rifle.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>In 1798, Chevau-Legers and Dragoon regiments were combined into a new type of cavalry, the Light Dragoons.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>For a brief period of time, the uniform of these equestrian combatants looked much like that of cuirassiers, although they wore no cuirasses. But after a succession of reforms, their units were changed and dragoons were given a new uniform that looked mostly like the heavy Dragoons' one.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The major task of these riders on the battlefield was as that of the heavy dragoons and they were armed with comparable weapons - broadsword and carbine.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Later, the chief commander decided to reorganize the regiments. Consequently, the regiments joined heavy Dragoon detachments, since light dragoons were much like heavy dragoons in terms of uniform, armament and field duties.</p>
