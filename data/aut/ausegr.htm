<strong>Fast soldier, weak in hand-to-hand combat, good shot, tireless, good for killing enemy officers, heavy coal consumption when shooting.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The light infantry in Austria was almost always an adjunct to the main army and was never considered to be an effective force or a tactical instrument. The units performing as light infantry were arranged along the lines of militia, made up of people who were not enlisted in the regular army.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>The effectiveness of such regiments was highly doubtful. For a long time, light infantry existed as an inexpensive force not requiring extensive training.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>In 1801, the Tyrolean Chasseurs regiment was organized, and it became the first large formation of light infantry in the Austrian army. The Tyrol region traditionally was a source of excellent marksmen for the army. The complement of a regiment was formed by a small number of Tyrolean snipers and the rest filled by volunteers.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>The chasseurs had equipment similar to the light infantry with at least some of them armed with rifles. Soldiers of these regiments often proved their bravery and marksmanship, and became famous as stealthy riflemen.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Even after the loss of the Tyrol in 1805, this regiment continued to exist.</p>
