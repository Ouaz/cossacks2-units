<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Cuirassier</h2>

<strong>High melee damage, pistols (double-shot), effectively demoralizes enemy in melee, is hard to shoot.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Cuirassiers of the Austrian cavalry were organized based on the example of Great Reiters and the Duke Maurits van Oranje cuirassiers. As with every Austrian horseman, they were highly trained and equipped with remarkable horses.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Cuirassiers were armed with a broadsword and two pistols. The pistols, however, were only used to protect themselves from enemy cavaliers.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Austrian cuirassiers, unlike cuirassiers from the rest of Europe, wore a semi-cuirass instead of a full cuirass, which was fixed to the undergarment with straps. Semi-cuirasses are inadequate as defensive armor, as shown in the battle of Eckmuhl.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>French and Austrian cuirassiers faced one another. The French cuirassiers wore full cuirasses and weren't really concerned about back stabs. Their only thought was of bursting through and striking blows on the enemy's rear, and they actually succeeded, managing to eliminate many Austrian horsemen while sustaining few casualties themselves. The battle lasted for only a few minutes until the Austrians, having suffered heavy casualties, were forced to flee.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>When the cuirassiers were retreating, they finally realized how inferior their armor was. The battle turned into a slaughter. The Austrians lost many dead and wounded, although they had proven themselves to be courageous warriors.</p>
