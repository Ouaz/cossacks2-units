<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Heavy Dragoon</h2>

<strong>Average melee damage, uses rifle, effectively demoralizes enemy in melee.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>As in other European armies, Austrian dragoons were established based on the model of the French dragoons. At the time of Franz II's accession, the army counted six dragoon regiments. After reforms in 1815, the number of regiments remained as previously.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Armed with broadsword, carbine and Roman-style helmet, Dragoons were employed for fierce attacks on both opposing infantry and cavalry.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>According to the 1784 statute, and the following 1806 one, Dragoons, as well as any other cavalry detachment, were supposed to assemble in columns and other massed formations only during a march, were forbidden to engage the enemy directly and could only attack as part of a flank defense maneuver.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Formations with a depth of up to two lines were the basis of Austrian cavalry doctrine. This frequently resulted in situations where dense formations of French cavalry, consisting mainly of ill-trained riders on swiftly chosen horses, would simply break through the thin lines of well-ordered Austrian Dragoons.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Additionally, as a result of the dearth of statute directives concerning the implementation of simultaneous attack by several regiments, Austrian Dragoons had to attack the enemy having only flanking cover from Uhlans and Hussars, and occasionally even on their own. One can foresee the consequences - defeat during the 1809 campaign.</p>
