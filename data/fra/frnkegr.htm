<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Chasseur</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, uses rifle.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Chasseurs were distinguished as a separate cavalry type after the revolutionary wars and the military campaign in Italy. The Emperor realized the necessity of establishing mobile cavalry units that could equally withstand the enemy in the vanguard or rear-guard and to be the "eyes and ears" of the entire army.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Mostly, chasseurs engaged in reconnaissance and ambushes of the enemy. Besides sabers, chasseurs were equipped with musketoons. On the battlefield they were used to support other cavalry units, mainly Uhlans and Cuirassiers.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>They used Henry II's carabineers' tactics, letting the enemy's cavalry come as close as fifty paces, or their infantry two hundred paces, and then firing on the enemy. Volleys were fired not by the line, but by the whole detachment simultaneously, after which they hid behind cuirassiers to reload their guns.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Sometimes they took part in pursuing the enemy.</p>
