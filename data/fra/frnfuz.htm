<h2 class="dataid">Fusilier</h2>

<strong>Average in hand-to-hand combat, light coal consumption when shooting, fast training speed.</strong>
<p>The name fusilier derives from the French word "fusil" - "rifle". This was the name given to regular line infantry soldiers of the French army, who weren't members of privileged or special-purpose regiments.</p>
<p>Usually fusiliers received a decent military training, and could effectively fight in melee and ranged combat. As in any line infantry units, the main training bias was on military drill, combat maneuver and hold-in-formation skills.</p>
<p>Individual combat and marksmanship trainings were rather superficial. First of all, soldiers were supposed to act simultaneously, so that, when ordered, to fire a mass musket volley at the enemy. In such type of shooting the individual skill of a rifleman wasn't really important.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, fusiliers fought and moved in a dense order: line, column or regrouped in a square. They were armed with a musket (1777 type), a bayonet and with half-saber (only till 1805). French fusiliers mainly fought in open areas, and were always in the front lines of the infantry were they had to take the worst of the enemy fire.</p>
