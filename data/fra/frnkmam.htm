<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Mameluke</h2>

<strong>High melee damage, pistols (double-shot), increased level of health.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Mamelukes in the French army were formed in 1800, when two more Janissary regiments were formed based on Kleber's regiment. They appeared in Europe after the Emperor had finished his campaign in Egypt. In 1803, by a decree on the 25th of February, an additional Mameluke regiment, which had been attached to a mounted-chasseur guard, was formed.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Mamelukes were armed with sabers of excellent quality and a brace of pistols, which they kept in saddle holsters. Their stirrups were fixed quite short, and both of the saddle pommels were high enough to prevent even a wounded Mameluke from falling from his horse.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>From early childhood Mamelukes were taught to handle the saber and horse riding, which made the Mameluke a fierce warrior and an outstanding master of equestrian battles.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Mamelukes used brilliant and fast Arabian horses, whose speed and maneuverability became legendary. Arabians became famous for their sudden attacks, which allowed them to break into the enemy's ranks, bringing death to foes.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Born riders, they could easily outflank the enemy's ranks and attack from the rear and with the same ease, they attacked enemy ranks from the flanks.</p>
