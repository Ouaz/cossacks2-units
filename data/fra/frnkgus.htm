<!-- 1 --><p>French army hussars were established according to the example of the original hussars, whom the old Hungary was famous for. The Emperor increased the number of hussar units to thirteen.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>French hussars, in addition to winning many women's hearts, became famous as the only cavalry in existence that had taken control of ships on the open sea.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>It was in January 1795, when some ships from Holland's battle fleet had frozen in ice not far from the city of Toxel. Having received these tidings, Napoleon sent a strong squadron of cavalry along with horse-drawn artillery to capture the vessels. They made it through the whole of northern Holland by forced march, passed the frozen Sudener See and, having surrounded the fleet, demanded its surrender. Surprised by the appearance of the cavalry and by its threats, the Dutch commanders agreed to lower their flags.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Hussar troops were used to cover infantry and artillery movement, supporting it during mustering and deployment. No troops have ever provided cover for infantry better than they did.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Hussars were armed with sabers and musketoons. The Hussars were famous for their mobility. They could easily outflank the enemy from the rear or flanks.</p>
