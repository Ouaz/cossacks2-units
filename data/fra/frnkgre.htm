<!-- 1 --><p>In addition to the foot grenadier regiments, mounted ones chose the best men for the job.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>The first mounted grenadier-guards company was established by Louis XIV in 1676. In fact, he used grenadiers both as cavalry and as foot soldiers.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Yet only the Emperor began to use mounted grenadiers exclusively as cavalry. Grenadiers on the battlefield were used for powerful attacks, when it was necessary to assure success.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>They were outstanding marksmen, their single volley could eliminate a whole squad. The volley was especially effective when it was fired fifty paces from the foe.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Although grenadiers were taught to fire from horseback, they preferred to slash the enemy, breaking into its ranks at full speed.</p>
