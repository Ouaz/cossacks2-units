<h2 class="dataid">Grenadier</h2>

<strong>Strong in hand-to-hand combat, can explode buildings with grenades, highly resistant to fatigue, medium training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Grenadier companies were elite line infantry and consisted of the tallest and bravest soldiers of a battalion. Perhaps, every ordinary fusilier wished to become a grenadier, as all the grenadiers were privileged troops and received increased rations and payment.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>The ones lucky enough to become grenadiers were very proud of that and looked down on other soldiers physically and figuratively. French grenadiers were famous by their stubborn and willful character, though they always justified the privileges rendered, having proved to be tireless and unbeatable fighters.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The very word "grenadier" has always been related to a tall soldier, terrifying in close combat. Military history records many cases when the attack of these giants put the enemy to flight.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>The armament of a grenadier consisted of a shortened (dragoon) musket with bayonet and half-saber.</p>
