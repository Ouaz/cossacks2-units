<!-- 1 --><p>If the Cuirassiers were supposed to be the elite cavalry, Carabineers were the elite of the elite. Their golden cuirasses shone in the sun, spreading fear among the enemy.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Carabineers were established in France during the reign of Henry II and were formed mostly from Gascons and Basques and constituted light cavalry. In 1693, Louis XIV combined them into one regiment and armed them with short carbines, bullets for which were made in both small and large sizes. Large was for maximum fit in the carbine barrel, and for which hammers were often used in reloading. The small rounds were for swift reloading when necessary. The Emperor divided carabineers into two regiments.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The Carabineers function on the battlefield had many similarities with that of the Cuirassiers - for crushing attacks on the enemy and for assuring success.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Carabineers were armed with a broadsword and short carbine, which subsequently was replaced with the English smooth-bore gun. They were good marksmen, and their fire inflicted heavy damage on enemy ranks. Carabineers preferred to fire from close range.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>They also had excellent training in handling the broadsword. No others in the French army could compare in swordsmanship mastery with the Carabineers.</p>
<!-- 6 --><p>The Carabineers' cuirass, just as that of the Cuirassiers, was well-suited for protecting from enemy bullets, arrows and case-shot.</p>
