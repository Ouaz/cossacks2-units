<h2 class="dataid">Light Cavalry</h2>

<strong>Average melee damage, pistols (double-shot).</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Light supporting Arab detachments were good warriors and riders, and in times of peace, they mostly acted as caravan guards and Mecca palmers.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Despite they were well versed in riding and swordsmanship, they could hardly rival the Mamelukes in it.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Each warrior was armed with two pistols, a saber and a dagger which were worn in their sash. Their uniform was gaily colored and their armament and weapons were excessively decorated with gold. Some warriors wore chain mail.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>As with the Mamelukes, additional light cavalry detachments never attacked in close order. In battle, they relied mainly on individual mastery. They often used false retreat and ambush tactics. If the troop was dispersed, the survivors retreated, regrouped and attacked the enemy again.</p>
