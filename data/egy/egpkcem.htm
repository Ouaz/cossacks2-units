<h2 class="dataid">Bedouin</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, uses rifle.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Bedouins were the tribes which inhabited Egyptian territory. Quite bellicose, they couldn't stand to have any strangers in their domain, as the nomads didn't waste an opportunity to attack neighboring lands.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Bedouins were wanderers, they more or less engaged in farming, but they always lived in tents. They often changed their location, wandering through their territory, to provide fodder for camels and to use well-water.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Bedouins quite often had to fight for their lands. Waging war mounted on camels, which were bred without assistance, each rider was armed with a bayonet-rifle, saber and a bandolier of 100 shells.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Bedouins always assaulted the enemy in open order, frequently accompanying an attack with strident screams.</p>
