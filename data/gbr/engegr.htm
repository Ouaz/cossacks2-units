<h2 class="dataid">Highlander</h2>

<strong>Weak in hand-to-hand combat, good shot, light coal consumption when shooting, has high morale, highly resistant to fatigue, fast training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The Scottish regiments, as an integral part of the British army, certainly deserve special attention. The Highlander regiments, as they were called in the British army, consisted of men from the mountainous (highland) parts of Scotland who were distinguished by their aggressive and proud temperament.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>In those regions, hunting and protection of cattle with firearms was a duty of almost all men. The Scottish recruits always became fine soldiers, as war was in their blood.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>All fifteen Highlander Regiments, used as shock troops, had a structure similar to regiments of line infantry. Other nationalities had various impressions of their shattering attacks and extravagant appearance, which led to the assigning of nicknames such as "ladies from hell" or "amazons".</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Highlanders wore uniforms that included kilts. Their Tam-o'-Shanter, decorated with black feathers, was the traditional headgear of the soldiers of these regiments and was decorated by adding a number of feathers, which is why it resembled a grenadier's cap.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>The role of drummers was attached to bagpipers, and only NCOs retained the traditional Scottish broadsword.</p>
