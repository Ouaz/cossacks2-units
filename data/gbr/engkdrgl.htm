<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Light Dragoon</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, uses rifle.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>By the end of 1800, all British cavalry had been shifted to Dragoons. Light cavalry leaders were transferred to Light Dragoons, which made up 29 regiments in the British army. In 1805, four light Dragoon regiments were reorganized into Hussar regiments.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Dragoons were mainly used to provide mounted scouting, to reinforce infantry and heavy dragoons, and screen the army.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>These horsemen were armed with sabers and carbines.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>British riders were well trained, but didn't have enough self-restraint to bear the title of the best European cavalry. This turned up in failures to regroup in timely fashion after striking the first blow.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>This weakness was completely overwhelmed by the personal courage of every warrior. Even Wellington once said that one British cavalry squadron could cope with two of the enemy's.</p>
