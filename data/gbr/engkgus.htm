<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Hussar</h2>

<strong>Average melee damage, short rifle (case-shot).</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Hussars as a single troop first appeared in Britain after 1805, when four dragoon regiments, namely the 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th, were reorganized into hussars.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Their establishment in the British army was caused mainly by the existence of similar regiments in all the other European armies, rather than for any tactical reasons.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>In spite of that, the 1st Arenschild's Hussars regiment, made up mostly of German soldiers, was considered to be the best mounted formation for outpost military service.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Basically, hussars dealt with mounted reconnaissance. Used in battles for infantry and cavalry support, hussars were equipped with sabers and musketoons.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>The preferred firing position for these cavaliers was beyond the enemy's bayonets, the middle distance. Hussars mastered swordsmanship with the saber quite well, favoring accurate piercing strikes to chopping blows.</p>
