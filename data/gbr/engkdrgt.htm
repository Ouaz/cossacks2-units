<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Heavy Dragoon</h2>

<strong>High melee damage, heavy rifle, effectively demoralizes enemy in melee.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>After 1800, all the functions of heavy cavalry in Britain were carried out by heavy dragoons. There were thirteen dragoon regiments in all, seven of which were guards. Two regiments were entirely German and were included in the royal German legion.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Dragoons were supposed to fiercely drive into a foe's infantry and cavalry. The horsemen were armed with broadswords and carbines. The broadsword in a dragoon's hands was a furious weapon indeed.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The British were undeniably unstoppable in attack. Thus, in the Garcia-Hernandez battle, the 3rd squadron under Rotmeister Gustaf von der Deken's command attacked a French infantry square formation. The squadron came under fire at 120 paces from the enemy and even the captain himself was severely wounded and many of his people were slain.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Nevertheless, they continued attacking and outflanked the square on two sides. The opening French lines raised their bayonets, but the accidental shooting of one dragoon caused him to fall onto the first line, thus creating the opportunity for the others to break through, notwithstanding an enemy volley.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Their efforts weren't wasted - the entire French battalion was slaughtered and the fleeing survivors were captured.</p>
