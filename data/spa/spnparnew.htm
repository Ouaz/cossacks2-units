<h2 class="dataid">Guerrilla</h2>

<strong>Weak in hand-to-hand combat, very fast training speed, rather resistant to fatigue, cannot be enhanced by officer staff.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Guerrillas (from "raiding party, skirmish" in Spanish) are irregular Spanish soldiers who were politically motivated to fight against the French invasion.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Historically, they usually operated in small groups to harass and sabotage the enemy troops.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>These are units with weak hand-to-hand combat indexes but decent firepower.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>However, since guerrillas are not part of the regular forces, it is impossible to attach an officer staff to their squads.</p>
