<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Cuirassier</h2>

<strong>High melee damage, pistols (double-shot), effectively demoralizes enemy in melee.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Prussian cuirassiers were the followers of the great Reiters. They took over many duties from the Duke Mauritz van Oranje's cuirassiers.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Cuirassiers suffered a fall into decay along with the entire Prussian cavalry. The spirit of Friedrich II's great cavalry was still alive in them, but it had a bare semblance of its former might on the battlefield. Thus, before the beginning of the war with France, cuirasses were abolished in cuirassier units, outfitting soldiers with a quilted jacket instead.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>The entire army suffered a lack of young and talented commanders, and those who served preferred to keep to the old tactics.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>This type of cavalry was merely meant for frontal attacks. These mounted troops usually attacked in close order, leaving a short distance of five to six paces between the riders. This quite often led to great losses when horsemen came under enemy fire.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>They preferred melee combat to fire-arms. Cuirassiers were armed with a broadsword and a brace of pistols, therefore their only possible firing option was at close range, when riders were fully involved in fierce melee combat. As a result, cuirassiers often used dragoons and chasseurs for support to direct fire on the enemy from long range, and preferred to attack in melee themselves.</p>
<!-- 6 --><p>After the Prussian defeat, only two cuirassier regiments were left.</p>
