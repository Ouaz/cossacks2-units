<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Dragoon</h2>

<strong>Average melee damage, uses rifle, effectively demoralizes enemy in melee.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>As Friedrich Wilhelm III succeeded to the throne, he obtained at his disposal dragoons of perfectly trained horsemen. The Prussian Dragoons were awesome equestrian warriors but had problems with fighting dismounted. They were trained to ignore enemy fire and courageously burst through the enemy ranks.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Dragoons were equipped with carbines and broadswords. They were strictly forbidden to fire mounted and had to use melee sword tactics only.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>In formation, the dragoons took their place between cuirassiers who were in the middle and hussars positioned on the flanks. During battle, dragoons had to cooperate effectively with both of them.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>During the reign of Friedrich Wilhelm, the dragoons, as did the whole Prussian cavalry, fell into decay. The army experienced a dire need for young and talented commanders, although it was up to the cavalry to prevent the dispersal of the entire army.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>In 1806, when Prussia lost the war against France, it turned into an embarrassing disaster - only five out of fourteen regiments remained fully manned, the rest of the army suffered great losses. Hardly any platoons or even single individuals managed to escape death or injury.</p>
