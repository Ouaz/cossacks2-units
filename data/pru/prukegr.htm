<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Chasseur</h2>

<strong>Low melee damage, uses rifle.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>Chasseurs appeared in the Prussian army right after the skirmishes with Austria, when the lack of multi-purpose light cavalry emerged. Mounted chasseurs became this type of cavalry. They were well trained and had ideal horses.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Since chasseurs were forbidden to use fire-arms in close order, they could only provide fire when patrolling or pursuing the enemy. Cavaliers were therefore good at handling fire-arms and were taught marksmanship and fast reloading.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Mounted chasseurs were mainly used to detain deserters and provide mounted reconnaissance.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Instead of sabers, they were equipped with muskets that allowed them to provide covering fire for infantry and attack dispersed enemy lines. Chasseurs usually attacked in solid order. The most highly trained ones could fire shots backwards from the saddle.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Chasseurs mostly interacted with cuirassiers, and were deadly marksmen. In order to reload, they hid behind the cuirassiers backs, thus supporting their attack and outflanking the enemy from the rear.</p>
