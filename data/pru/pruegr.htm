<h2 class="dataid">Chasseur</h2>

<strong>Fast soldier, weak in hand-to-hand combat, good shot, tireless, good for killing enemy officers, heavy coal consumption when shooting.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The light infantry appeared in Prussia at the time of Friedrich the Great (1740-1786) and continued to increase in number during the following years.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>By a separate decree, the Prussian monarch founded the so-called foot chasseurs. This regiment was always regarded as elite and Prussia never had a second chasseurs regiment.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Apart from the foot chasseurs, the Prussian light infantry included so-called "voluntary regiments", which originally were hardly different from brigand gangs, but in the course of time they were transformed into fusilier battalions (some of them to subsequently reinforce the chasseur regiment).</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Originally, chasseurs were used for patrolling, but gradually began to carry out various other tasks, such as scouting, line infantry support and sniping at the enemy from ambushes.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>The units were made up of hunters and foresters, which ensured the chasseurs were sharp shooters. Their regular weapon became a rifled weapon - the carbine. The difference in accuracy between smooth-bore and rifled weapons was significant. Due to this, the effectiveness of chasseurs using carbines did not suffer despite their lower rate of fire compared to smooth-bore guns.</p>
