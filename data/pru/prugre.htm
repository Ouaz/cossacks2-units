<!-- 1 --><p>By the beginning of war with France, the Prussian infantry regiment consisted of ten musketeer and two grenadier companies.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>All Prussian grenadiers, as proper, were tall and strong soldiers. They had special privileges, in particular, were better trained, fed and supplied than others.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Unlike French grenadiers who often fought other types of French soldiers and even officers, Prussians, including the representatives of these elite units, behaved with the German-like law-obedience.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Besides, there did not establish the custom of arrogant behavior towards the other rank and file as was the case with many other armies. These grenadiers always displayed an example of valour and courage toward their fellow soldiers.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Prussian grenadiers didn't wear high furry hats as peculiar of grenadiers at that time period, but instead wore a headdress with a high frontal plate edged with a fur tape. From a distance, it did resemble the common grenadier hat.</p>
