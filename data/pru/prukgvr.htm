<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Guard</h2>

<strong>Very high melee damage, uses rifle, effectively demoralizes enemy in melee, increased level of health.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The Guard regiment constituted part of the cuirassier regiments and had the lucky number "13". After Frederick the Great's death, that regiment consisted of three double-companied squadrons. Their complement didn't change until 1798, when Friedrich Wilhelm III, having succeeded to the throne, reorganized the regiment into a five squadron structure.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>This type of cavalry was mainly used for destructive assaults. Close order was used for attacks, the distance between the horsemen usually didn't exceed five to six paces.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Soldiers preferred melee combat to shooting, as Warnery noted with precision: "The squadron that relies only on firearms will be defeated by the squadron that attacks without firing a shot".</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Despite the fact that guard troops still had the immortal spirit of the Grand Seydlitz cavalry, the army was falling into decay. The worst failing of the entire Prussian army was that their top commanders old age adversely affected the army's status.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Although, in the war with France, the Guards proved themselves to be brilliant warriors and the 13th regiment ended the war having retained its initial complement.</p>
