<h2 class="dataid">Mounted Hussar</h2>

<strong>Average melee damage, short rifle (case-shot).</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The Prussian Hussars were founded in 1721 based on the example of the Hungarian hussars. The troops ran to nine squadrons, three of which were "Lifeguards Hussars" and six "Prussian Hussars".</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>After Friedrich II encountered light Austrian cavalry, he subsequently decided to strengthen his own regiments. Thus, in 1741, five more regiments were created. One of the regiments, the 4th hussars, was mostly made up of Polish deserters. Three more regiments were formed in 1744, the other ones after 1758.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Hussars were used to provide outpost service and to perform mounted reconnaissance. Also, they were used to cover infantry on the battlefield and support Cuirassiers.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Soldiers of this type were armed with sabers and musketoons. Their firing range was limited to a middle distance from the enemy, without getting too close.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Hussars were supposed to be outstanding swordsmen, but they weren't quite competitive in striking power with the lesser-trained dragoons, who compensated for their lack of martial education with heavy, damaging blows.</p>
