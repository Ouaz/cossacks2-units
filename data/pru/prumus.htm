<h2 class="dataid">Musketeer</h2>

<strong>Weak in hand-to-hand combat, very fast training speed.</strong>
<!-- 1 --><p>The basic tactics of the Prussian line infantry during the Napoleonic wars was the suppression of the enemy with an rapid rate of fire and then achievement of final victory by decisive bayonet attack.</p>
<!-- 2 --><p>Thus, the main focus in training was on increasing the fire rate: a Prussian musketeer, for instance, was considered to be able to shoot three times as fast as a French one. In practice though, it wasn't true. Despite the good training, a multitude of aggravating smaller hindrances made it impossible to effectively employ the Prussian infantry on the battlefield.</p>
<!-- 3 --><p>Basically, at that time, the line infantry of any European country lacked a variety of tactics. However, the tactics of Prussian musketeers were predictable and inefficient to the highest degree. Therefore, their actions grew ever less effective, while huge losses, as a rule, were caused by tactical and strategic blunders of the command.</p>
<!-- 4 --><p>Despite everything, the infantry's fighting capacity and morale remained at a high level during the entire Napoleonic epoch.</p>
<!-- 5 --><p>Prussian musketeers were armed with a musket, bayonet and a cutlass. It is worth noting that Prussian muskets of that time had high accuracy of fire and reliability.</p>
